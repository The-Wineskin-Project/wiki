**Welcome to The Wineskin Project wiki!**

Wineskin allows you to create bundled Wine prefixes and run Windows programs like any other macOS apps.  
It consists of three primary components: Wineskin Winery to set up wrappers, a Master Wrapper as a template,  
and Engine(s) to fill in Wine binaries.
